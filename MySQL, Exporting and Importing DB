**LINUX NOTICE** it looks like on Linux we will not need the "./" in ./mysql

1. First we need to gain access to the mysql bin directory. On my mac the direcotry is "cd /usr/local/mysql/bin"

2. Next we need to do a mysql data dump. We will need the name and password of the root user for the server or the db,
I am not sure? You then need to supply the name of the db in question. Finally suply the path of where the file should be
generated and you must name the filel.

./mysqldump -uroot -ppassword -hlocalhost kemmitone >~/kemmitdb.sql

3. The db has now been exported into a single file. Lets now import that db.

4. To begin importing, lets head over to  the mysql bin direcotry of the new server. Again you will need credntials for the
root user of the server and the db.

5. In bin run command <./mysql -uroot -ppassword -hlocalhost>

6. Once logged into mysql create a new database, we will name ours temp. Log out of MySQL using the keyword quit.

7. Now we can import the file/dbdump run command <./mysql -uroot -ppassword -hlocalhost temp < ~/kemmitdb.sql>
The temp db we created will recieve all of the data from the file we imported.
